## Workflow ReactJS

# :warning: Disclaimer
Instead of using this project, prefer [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

---

### What's inside it?

* Webpack 3+
* Babel
* React hot loader
* HTML and CSS generated automatically by webpack
* Jest for tests and Chai for assertions
* Storybook to create isolatelly components' stories
* Async/await
* Dynamic `import()` function
* Webpack tree shaking!
* [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for production build (optional)

### Dependencies:

- Node.js `>=` v6;

### Up and running

- Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:fdaciuk/workflow-reactjs.git`;
- Remove `.git` directory;
- Install dependencies: `yarn` (or `npm i`);
- Run `yarn dev` (or `npm start`) to develop on `http://localhost:3000`
- Run `yarn build` (or `npm run build`) for production build (files will be generated on `dist` directory)

### Troubleshooting

If you are on Windows, and try to run `yarn lint`, you'll get an error
because `spawn` module does not work very well on Windows.

You should install `cross-spawn`, and edit `gulpfile.js`, removing line `4` and
uncomment line `7`.

A big thanks to [@hgtpcastro](https://github.com/hgtpcastro) for this tip.
